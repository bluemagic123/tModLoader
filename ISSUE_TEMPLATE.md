<!--

PLEASE use the following template when creating an issue. We can't exactly know what every issue is about before it's posted, so we set a baseline of information required to suit all possible issues. (hopefully) 

Do you want to ask a question? Are you looking for support? Our discord server is more suitable for this: http://discord.me/tmodloader

You should only create an issue thread to report an actual issue related to the tModLoader API.
If you think something is mod related, report to the mod's respective author(s), not us.
